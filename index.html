        <p>This is the brief portfolio of Melvin James Bryant III.</p>
        <p>Born in <a href="https://discoveratlanta.com">Atlanta,</a> Georgia on May 17th, 1997, Melvin is the youngest child of Melvin and Traci Bryant. Bryant has a twin brother named Devin, and an older sister named Morgan. Here are two things that Melvin values the most in his life:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>He values his allegiance to God.</li>
          <li>The love that he has for his family is paramount.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Although Bryant has always been athletically gifted, there was still room for him to manifest his academic gift. A late bloomer in all aspects of life, Bryant utilized his athletic gift to his advantage. He was always regarded to be the <a href="https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/schedule/27-july">fastest</a> in school up until he reached the 9th grade.</p>
        <p>Even though he sought to improve his athletic abilities, he also diverted his attention to an area of improvement that he considered important:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>His faith, hope, trust, devotion, and love for God is what he believes to be the driving force of his life. He is a major advocate for Bible scriptures like Psalm 37:4-5, which reads, "Delight yourself also in the LORD, and He shall give you the desires of your heart. Commit your way to the LORD, trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass."</li>
          <li>Because of this, Bryant has maintained his faithfulness to God as a Christian in the church of Christ.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Bryant's 10th grade year was the most challenging time of his academic life. This was the same year when he left his freshman football team as a benchwarmer to focus on his grades. Another reason was due to bronchitis, which he had the week before playing in his first game. Embarrassed by the departure, Bryant sought the taste of victory in academics. However, he was met with a multitude of defeats that would further motivate him to seek life's victory.</p>
        <p>Bryant's Triumph:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Many years later, Bryant would suffer an agonizing defeat upon taking the Law School Admissions Test the 7th and final time, at the age of 26. 3 months later, he was fired from a corporate law firm. Upon 3 more months, his work-from-home contract role abruptly ended after seeing glimpses of a permanent role ahead. Furthermore, at the age 27, the University of Georgia School of Law presented Bryant with many signs of optimism for admittance. However, after rounds of waitlisting, Bryant was rejected in the final round. Bryant knew from this moment, that God would eventually bless him with the taste of victory that much sweeter.</li>
          <li>Taking a 2 week trip to Mexico in March of 2024 <a href="https://vallarta.grandvelas.com/newsroom/hotel/americanssaferinmexico#:~:text=What%20you%20don't%20get,Mexico's%20most%20popular%20travel%20destinations.">enlightened</a> Bryant's understanding on what he wanted out of life. This was his start of embarking on a triumphant journey.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After exploring the vibrant and sprawling Mexico City, Bryant met <code>Monse Villanueva Vivanco</code> in the enriching terrains of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Pachuca">Pachuca, Mexico.</a> The two would become very close and stay in touch during Bryant's departure from Mexico back to Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Upon touching down back to Atlanta, Bryant wanted to experience those moments again. Those moments in the same country, the same city, and with the same person he met along the way is what currently motivates him. This new dawn of a journey gave him another perspective that he knows will come into fruition.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>As Bryant continues to pen his story of victory, he seeks to inspire the reader of never giving up, and to consider the brief episodes of tribulation he endured, which are outlined in his portfolio.</li>
          <li>With this new dawn ensuing in Bryant's life, he feels blessed and thankful to have conveyed his ongoing story in the third person. My good friend, please join me as I discuss my plans for the future that I am rigorously working toward. Your support means more than the world to me :)</li>

        <p>After my expedition to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Mexico">Mexico</a>, I moved to Canton, Georgia, from Kennesaw, Georgia, after being kicked out of my parent's apartment. Fast forwarding to several weeks later, I found myself as a contract paralegal (also a contract position) with my alumni institution of Kennesaw State University (Hooty-Hoo)! A month later in June, I joined the <code>FreeCodeCamp</code> curriculum to obtain certifications in <code>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Front-End Web Development.</code> My goal is to become a front-end web developer or software engineer, with the blessing of a sustainable income, working remotely, traveling the world, and having the work-life-balance I long desired. My newly found passion in coding has led me to this amazing portion of the curriculum.</p>
        <p>I promise to fulfill my dream, and I will refuse to stop until it happens. Your life is worth fighting for. Make your story a great one that is worth telling.</p>
