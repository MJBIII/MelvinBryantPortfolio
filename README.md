The purpose of this project was to build a technical documentation page, which was an assignment halfway into FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification. I decided to create a personal portfolio story which highlights nearly everything building up to my coding journey. This assignment really helped me improve my understanding on the navigation bar in HTML and how to appropriately apply the list item, unordered list, and the anchor elements in CSS, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience and accessibility of my personal story portfolio.
